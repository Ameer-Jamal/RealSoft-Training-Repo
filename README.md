# RealSoft-Training-Repo
A Repo of my training at REALSOFT Advanced Applications
For Task Zero The Idea was to make a page using js and local storage to be able to add a list of your faviourate books with their rating, cover photo, and name. then have functionality to 
-filter all books to books with a certain rating 
-implement pagination 
-Add a Book
-Delete a book by clicking on its cover image 
-have a button that sorts the books to best first 
-Save books to local storage 
-save books as an object 
-other relevant JS features
